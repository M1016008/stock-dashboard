# US StockBoard JP Parity Program

Updated: 2026-10-12

The machine-readable source of truth is `docs/us-stockboard-parity-board.json`. Run
`npm run audit:us-jp-parity` after every wave. The data contract is maintained in
`docs/us-stockboard-data-source-matrix.md`.

## Dependency waves

| Wave | Scope | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| W0 | Inventory, persistent board, data contracts, PIT and future-leakage guards | Board validation, PIT tests, typecheck, build |
| W1 | Stock Detail technical workspace: overview, chart, 6 Stage, Stage History, momentum, scenario, similars | Claude browser review, multi-ticker, four viewports, semantic regression |
| W2 | Dashboard, Screener, Preview, Search, Historical date | Data parity, request/performance budget, historical cross-page parity |
| W3 | Earnings, transitions, backtest, AI, market momentum, sectors, triggers, MTF calendar | Source coverage, PIT, market-calendar and global milestone QA |
| W4 | Fundamentals, valuation and shareholder return | SEC fact contract and forecast-source stop condition |
| W5 | Institutional ownership and US-specific substitutes | Source/licensing approval, final closure loop |

## Current blockers

- Forecast consensus requires an approved source.
- Short-interest serving requires an approved/licensed source.
- Institutional ownership scope requires a product choice between 13F, 13D/G, and insider Form 4 views.
- Historical market cap requires point-in-time shares outstanding.
- Historical classification filters require effective-dated classification history.

These blockers do not stop technical, discovery, chart, Stage, scenario, ML, responsive,
performance, or historical-price parity work.

## Completed evidence

### W0 - PIT contract

- Main and Production: `230faeab1743acc31acbf93c3608d47deb2c244e`
- US screener requests use the explicit PIT contract and reject unsupported future data.
- Typecheck, production build, PIT contract tests, API PIT tests and Production smoke passed.

### W1 - Stock Detail technical workspace

- Claude Code `claude-opus-5-5` (`claude.ai`, firstParty, Pro) completed the editorial audit,
  implementation and final visual self-review.
- Overview, chart controls, current 6 Stage, Stage History, Physical Momentum/MA, scenario and
  similar-analysis presentation now share the JP analytical reading order without changing the
  underlying Stage, momentum, scenario or similarity calculations.
- Historical mode no longer substitutes the latest quote or a synthetic zero-percent move when
  the requested date is unavailable.
- Browser QA covered AAPL, JPM, CAT, XOM, JNJ, KO, TSLA, PLTR, RIVN and SOFI. AAPL was checked at
  1440, 1024, 768 and 390 px; page overflow, console errors, failed requests and duplicate ML
  status requests were all zero in the final run.
- Dedicated Stock Detail parity tests, relevant shared regressions, typecheck and production build
  passed. Production and friend-access verification remain the W1 release gate.
